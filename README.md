# Cplusplus
This repository contains a number of programs I made in C++ to practice data structures and algorithms. Most of the questions, at the moment are from Coding Block's Launchpad course. All the .cpp files contain the problem statement in a comment in the starting of the program.

## Arrays

### This folder contains programs using:-

- 1-D Arrays
- 2-D Arrays
- Strings
  [BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC]

## Bitmasking

### This folder contains programs that:-

- solve problems more efficiently by manipulating the bits of the provided data.

## Fundamentals

### This folder contains programs about:- 
- Basic concepts such as:
  - Datatypes
  - Type conversions
  - Pointers
- Loops
  - Patterns
- Different types of operators, including:
  - Arithmetic
  - Logical
  - Bitwise
  - Logical
  - Conditional
  - Miscellaneous
    - Dereference (*)
    - Address of (&)
## Linked Lists

### This folder contains problems regarding linked lists such as:-

- Sorting
- Searching
- Insertion
- Deletion

### Both doubly and singly linked lists are used. Linked lists have been implemented through self referential structures / classes.

## Searching and Sorting

### This folder contains programs using:-
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Wave Sort
- Counting Sort
- Inbuilt sort function

## Number Theory

### This folder consists of programs made using the basics of number theory

## Recursion

### In this folder, a variety of different problems and algorithms have been implemented using recursion.

### The concept of backtracking is also used in some problems.

## Searching and Sorting

### This folder consists of various algorithms used for searching and sorting

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Counting Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Wave Sort

note:- Programs for merge sort and quick sort are in the recursion folder since they have been implemented recursively and not iteratively.

## Stacks and Queues

### This folder consists of programs having practical usage of stacks and queus and the implementation of stacks and queues using:- 

- Static arrays
- Dynamic arrays
- Linked lists
- Vectors
